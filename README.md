# Airbitz Recovery

This is a tool to recover funds from an Airbitz HD Seed.

You can try out the tool with an empty seed such as: "1dafe5a826590b3f9558dd9e1ab1d8b86fda83a4bcc3aeeb95d81f0ab95c3d62" or by exporting the private seed from your Airbitz wallet via Export>>Wallet Private Seed (advanced)

You can now also also use BIP 39 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) Mnemonic codes and the tool will display your seed info.
Example Mnemonic code: "select scout crash enforce riot rival spring whale hollow radar rule sentence"
